Write a program which asks for two integer numbers.
The program should then print out whichever is greater.
If the numbers are equal, the program should print a different message.
Examples:
    Please type in the first number: 5
    Please type in another number: 3
    The greater number was: 5

    Please type in the first number:: 5
    Please type in another number: 8
    The greater number was: 8

    Please type in the first number: 5
    Please type in another number: 5
    The numbers are equal!

Python comparison operators can also be used on strings. 
String a is smaller than string b if it comes alphabetically before b. Notice however that the comparison is only reliable if
- the characters compared are of the same case, i.e. both UPPERCASE or both lowercase
- only the standard English alphabet of a to z, or A to Z, is used.

Write a program which asks the user for two words. The program should then print out whichever of the two comes alphabetically last.

You can assume all words will be typed in lowercase entirely.

Examples:
Please type in the 1st word: car
Please type in the 2nd word: scooter
scooter comes alphabetically last.

Please type in the 1st word: zorro
Please type in the 2nd word: batman
zorro comes alphabetically last.

Please type in the 1st word: python
Please type in the 2nd word: python
You gave the same word twice.
